# Set environment variables

Postiz configuration is entirely via environment variables for now. You might be used to setting environment variables when starting containers,
however postiz needs a LOT of environment variables, so setting these on command line or in a docker-compose is probably not practical for long
term maintainability.

It is recommended to use a `.env` file, which the Postiz containers look for in /config. Docker will automatically create this file for you on a 
docker volume the first time you start up Postiz. 

The default .env file can be found here; [example .env file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitroomhq/postiz-app/main/.env.example)

## Create the container

This example below shows how to create the Postiz container on the command line.

Note that you will need to replace the `./config` with the path to your config directory. You will also need Postgres and Redis running.

```bash
docker create --name postiz -v ./config:/config -p 4200:4200 -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/gitroomhq/postiz-app:latest
```
